@implementation Common

// +commandInfo returns a dictionary that represents everything we need to know about the
// authorized commands supported by the app.  Each dictionary key is the string form of
// the command selector.  The corresponding object is a dictionary that contains three items:
//
// o kCommandKeyAuthRightName is the name of the authorization right itself.  This is used by
//   both the app (when creating rights and when pre-authorizing rights) and by the tool
//   (when doing the final authorization check).
//
// o kCommandKeyAuthRightDefault is the default right specification, used by the app to when
//   it needs to create the default right specification.  This is commonly a string contacting
//   a rule a name, but it can potentially be more complex.  See the discussion of the
//   rightDefinition parameter of AuthorizationRightSet.
//
// o kCommandKeyAuthRightDesc is a user-visible description of the right.  This is used by the
//   app when it needs to create the default right specification.  Actually, string is used
//   to look up a localized version of the string in "Common.strings".
//
//   The kCommandKeyAuthRightDesc strings here contain EBAS as as shortcut for
//   EvenBetterAuthorizationSample.  However, the values in "Common.strings" contain the fully
//   expanded name, which allows you to see whether localization is working properly.
//
//   These strings are also surrounded by NSLocalizedString, which makes it easy to use
//   <x-man-page://1/genstrings> to create an initial "Common.strings".
